# Basic Blockchain Implementation in Python

Welcome to the Basic Blockchain Implementation project! This project is designed to help you understand the core concepts of blockchain technology by building a simple blockchain from scratch using Python.

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, a reference to the previous block, and a unique hash (a cryptographic fingerprint).

## Key Concepts in This Project

1. **Block**:
   - A block is a container for data (e.g., transactions).
   - Each block has:
     - An `index` (its position in the chain).
     - A `timestamp` (when it was created).
     - `Data` (the information it stores).
     - A `previous_hash` (the hash of the previous block in the chain).
     - A `hash` (its own unique fingerprint, calculated using SHA-256).
     - A `nonce` (a number used in mining to find a valid hash).

2. **Blockchain**:
   - A blockchain is a chain of blocks linked together using hashes.
   - The first block in the chain is called the **Genesis Block**.

3. **Proof of Work (PoW)**:
   - A consensus algorithm used to secure the blockchain.
   - Miners solve a computational puzzle (finding a hash with a specific number of leading zeros) to add a new block to the chain.

4. **Hashing**:
   - A process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters using a cryptographic function (SHA-256 in this case).
   - Ensures data integrity and security.

## How the Code Works

### 1. Block Class
- Represents a single block in the blockchain.
- Contains:
  - `index`: The block's position in the chain.
  - `timestamp`: When the block was created.
  - `data`: The information stored in the block.
  - `previous_hash`: The hash of the previous block.
  - `nonce`: A number used in mining.
  - `hash`: The block's unique fingerprint.

### 2. Blockchain Class
- Manages the chain of blocks.
- Contains:
  - `chain`: A list of blocks.
  - `difficulty`: The number of leading zeros required in the hash (controls mining difficulty).
- Methods:
  - `create_genesis_block()`: Creates the first block in the chain.
  - `get_latest_block()`: Returns the last block in the chain.
  - `add_block()`: Adds a new block to the chain after mining.
  - `proof_of_work()`: Implements the mining process.
  - `is_chain_valid()`: Validates the integrity of the blockchain.

### 3. Mining
- Mining is the process of finding a valid hash for a new block.
- Miners adjust the `nonce` until the block's hash meets the difficulty requirement (e.g., starts with a certain number of zeros).

### 4. Validation
- The blockchain is validated by checking:
  - If each block's hash is correct.
  - If each block points to the correct previous block.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Install Python**:
   - If you donâ€™t have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Save the Code**:
   - Copy the code into a file and save it as `blockchain.py`.

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `blockchain.py` is saved.
   - Run the script:
     ```
     python blockchain.py
     ```

4. **Observe the Output**:
   - The script will:
     - Mine three blocks.
     - Print the blockchain.
     - Validate the blockchain.
